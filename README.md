# Microservices

_I really couldn't find a better name_

We are slowly migrating some of our shared services into a microservices. We will start with this monorepo to collect this WIP.

## Contents

Currently, we have:

- raterpc (a service that returns the current SDG -> USD rate)
- key (a working key rpc implementation)
